## BionicRepo for Legacy iDevices


This repository is made for Legacy iDevices. On your iDevice running iPhoneOS 2-6, open `Cydia`.

Enter this repository link: `bionicrepo.github.io/ipod`

Don't get confused with the 'ipod' instead of 'repo', it's an accident and will work on any Legacy iDevice.


That's all :)
